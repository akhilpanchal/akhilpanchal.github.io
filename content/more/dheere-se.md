## Original Credits
##### Artist: The Yellow Diary
##### Album: Izafa (2018)
##### Label: Sony Music India

It was 2018, when I first heard The Yellow Diary. Their single, [__*Marz*__](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zjboLjIt8w) played a couple times through the Discover playlist on my Spotify. Few years pass by, COVID hits. In 2020 I rediscovered their music.

[*__Buniyaad__*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_dfcNg2MOg), another great track. This one hit me when I was listening to it while taking a shower ðŸ˜„.

[*__Dheere Se__*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jL27HdBJx1U) was a very different track, one that I did not expect from TYD. It would have been that song which a producer would have removed from the album, just like Tum Ho Toh was in the movie Rock On!. Touched my heart instantly.

I recorded this when the pandemic was at it's peak. I shared this on Instagram and TYD shared it on their story. My day was made ðŸ˜„.
