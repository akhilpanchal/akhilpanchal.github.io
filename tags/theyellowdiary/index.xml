Their single, Marz played a couple times through the Discover playlist on my Spotify. Few years pass by, COVID hits. In 2020 I rediscovered their music.
Buniyaad, another great track. This one hit me when I was listening to it while taking a shower ðŸ˜„.
Dheere Se was a very different track, one that I did not expect from TYD.</description></item></channel></rss>
