Thanks for stopping by my humble abode on the internet.

I am Akhil Panchal. Software Engineer by profession. I aspire to write clean and minimalist code that humans can read and maintain.

I decided to create [algorythm.dev](https://algorythm.dev) to document my journey of being a _professional_ Software Engineer, as well as other interests that I explore.
