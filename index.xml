Their single, Marz played a couple times through the Discover playlist on my Spotify. Few years pass by, COVID hits. In 2020 I rediscover their music. Dheere Se was a very different track, one that I did not expect from TYD. It would have been that song which a producer would have removed from the album, like Tum Ho Toh was in the movie Rock On!</description></item><item><title>Hello! üëãüèΩ</title><link>https://algorythm.dev/about/</link><pubDate>Sat, 05 Mar 2022 09:41:52 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://algorythm.dev/about/</guid><description>Thanks for stopping by my humble abode on the internet.
