&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost_Coast">The Lost Coast Trail&lt;/a>, a rugged 25-mile stretch of Northern California’s coastline, offers a rare glimpse into untouched wilderness. With no roads and only the ocean as a guide, hikers navigate rocky beaches and towering cliffs, leaving civilization far behind. This remote path is not just a hike, but an immersion into nature&amp;rsquo;s raw beauty and power. It&amp;rsquo;s not merely a place on the map; it’s a forgotten edge of the world. It’s the space where the Pacific’s roar meets an untamed land, and time dissolves into the pull of the tides. For two nights and three days, six friends, a dog named Zora, and I set foot upon this wild frontier, seeking both adventure and ourselves. What we found wasn’t just a coastline lost to modernity, but a part of ourselves that had been buried under the weight of routine and noise.&lt;/p></description><content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="a-journey-beyond-the-horizon">A Journey Beyond the Horizon</h3>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost_Coast">The Lost Coast Trail</a>, a rugged 25-mile stretch of Northern California’s coastline, offers a rare glimpse into untouched wilderness. With no roads and only the ocean as a guide, hikers navigate rocky beaches and towering cliffs, leaving civilization far behind. This remote path is not just a hike, but an immersion into nature&rsquo;s raw beauty and power. It&rsquo;s not merely a place on the map; it’s a forgotten edge of the world. It’s the space where the Pacific’s roar meets an untamed land, and time dissolves into the pull of the tides. For two nights and three days, six friends, a dog named Zora, and I set foot upon this wild frontier, seeking both adventure and ourselves. What we found wasn’t just a coastline lost to modernity, but a part of ourselves that had been buried under the weight of routine and noise.</p>
<h3 id="the-meaning-of-the-lost-coast">The Meaning of the Lost Coast</h3>
<p>The very name &ldquo;Lost Coast&rdquo; hints at something far beyond geography. It evokes the notion of what can only be found when something else is surrendered. Here, there are no carefully groomed trails, no comforting signals of civilization. Instead, there’s raw nature, bending you to its rhythms, its whims, and reminding you that sometimes, to lose control is to truly begin.</p>
<p>From the first step onto its shifting sands, we were confronted with the paradox of the Lost Coast: how can you lose yourself, yet feel more grounded than ever? As the Pacific wind buffeted us, and the waves carved endless shapes in the cliffs, there was a sense of surrender — an acknowledgment that we were visitors in a place where nature had the final say. The constant crashing of the ocean was a reminder of time’s relentless march, a force that could erase footprints and plans alike. Yet, in that seeming erasure, something profound emerged: presence. Each moment became acute, demanding our full attention.</p>
<h3 id="the-power-of-silence-and-solitude">The Power of Silence and Solitude</h3>
<p>On the second day, Zora led the way with her boundless energy, a silent guide to what it meant to be free in this space. Around her neck was a small bell, its soft chime blending with the natural soundscape. It was a pleasing, constant note, ringing just above the hush of the waves and the rustle of the wind. Unlike the harsh sounds of civilization, Zora&rsquo;s bell was a reminder of companionship and life, a gentle pulse in the background of our journey. There were long stretches where none of us spoke, the only sounds being the soothing chime of her bell and the endless crash of the ocean.</p>
<p>In those quiet spaces, it became clear: the Lost Coast strips you of distractions and forces you to confront your own thoughts. The natural world is indifferent to your plans, your ambitions, your deadlines. It simply is. And in its simplicity, there is a clarity that’s hard to find in the frenzy of daily life.</p>
<h3 id="the-weight-of-the-pack">The Weight of the Pack</h3>
<p>As we made our way along the rugged terrain, the packs on our backs seemed to grow heavier with each passing hour. They held everything we needed for survival: food, water, shelter. And yet, they also symbolized something else. The pack was a metaphor for the weight we carry every day—burdens we’ve grown so accustomed to that we forget they’re there until they become too much. The Lost Coast, however, does not allow you to forget. Every step reminds you of the load you bear, both physically and mentally.</p>
<p>But with every nightfall, as we set up camp and let the fire crackle under the stars, the weight seemed to lift. Not because the packs were any lighter, but because we were learning to balance the load—both on our shoulders and in our minds. The conversations around the fire grew deeper, more honest. We were unburdening ourselves in ways that could only happen after days of shared struggle and solitude.</p>
<h3 id="lost-and-found">Lost, and Found</h3>
<p>By the third day, as we neared the end of the trail, something had shifted. We had lost something out there on the Lost Coast. Not our direction, not our way, but a sense of rigidity that we had carried with us. The experience of being in a place so vast, so untamed, made us realize how small our problems were. The world was not asking us to conquer it but to witness it, to be a part of its endless cycle. The Lost Coast does not demand mastery; it invites surrender.</p>
<p>As we said goodbye to the cliffs, the black sands, and the relentless waves, we took with us the realization that sometimes to be lost is the best way to be found. The Lost Coast had given us no answers, but it had asked the right questions—questions we would carry long after the trail was behind us.</p>
<p>And so, we left that edge of the world, not the same people who had arrived. We were no longer clinging to control, but instead, embracing the unknown. The Lost Coast had stripped us down, and in that stripping, we had found a version of ourselves that could breathe deeply, live fully, and wander freely.</p>
<p>Sometimes, it takes being lost to truly be found.</p>

&lt;p>A couple of years ago, I was on what should have been just another adventure. Rajas and I were tackling Lion&amp;rsquo;s Head near Toronto, Ontario, when disaster struck—I pushed my knee too hard, and it gave way. That injury turned out to be more serious than I’d imagined. Any hike after that would trigger sharp knee pain after just a few kilometers. It felt like I was sidelined forever, watching as my friends explored the outdoors without me. For almost a year, I couldn’t join them, and the frustration was real.&lt;/p></description><content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="a-setback-on-lions-head">A Setback on Lion&rsquo;s Head</h3>
<p>A couple of years ago, I was on what should have been just another adventure. Rajas and I were tackling Lion&rsquo;s Head near Toronto, Ontario, when disaster struck—I pushed my knee too hard, and it gave way. That injury turned out to be more serious than I’d imagined. Any hike after that would trigger sharp knee pain after just a few kilometers. It felt like I was sidelined forever, watching as my friends explored the outdoors without me. For almost a year, I couldn’t join them, and the frustration was real.</p>
<h3 id="bouncing-back-with-a-new-goal">Bouncing Back with a New Goal</h3>
<p>After months of physio and working through some personal turmoil, I was determined to make a comeback. Not just any comeback, though—I had my eyes set on Half Dome, the crown jewel of Yosemite’s hikes. This wasn’t going to be easy, but I was ready to put in the work. With the support of friends and a desire to conquer my fears (and my knee), the journey began.</p>
<h3 id="pawans-silent-influence">Pawan&rsquo;s Silent Influence</h3>
<p>One of the key figures in my preparation was my friend Pawan. Now, Pawan wasn’t my personal trainer in the traditional sense, but his habits were contagious. Watching his dedication to working out and his overall discipline made a big impact on me. His routine became a blueprint for my own training, and I got into the best shape of my life without even realizing it. You could say his presence alone was enough to push me to train hard for Half Dome.</p>
<h3 id="the-big-day-a-14-hour-journey">The Big Day: A 14-Hour Journey</h3>
<p>The day finally came. We kicked off the Half Dome hike at 4 a.m., under the cover of darkness and excitement. The trail is no joke—steep, relentless, and with its famous cables challenge awaiting near the summit. As we ascended, we battled shifting weather and fatigue, but every step felt like a victory over the past year of struggles. When we finally reached back at the trailhead at 6 p.m., the feeling was surreal. Fourteen hours on the trail, and we had conquered it!</p>
<h3 id="missing-my-hiking-buddy-rajas">Missing My Hiking Buddy, Rajas</h3>
<p>Throughout the hike, I couldn’t help but think of Rajas. He had been there during my injury and had been such a huge part of my love for the outdoors. We had shared countless hikes together, and his absence on Half Dome was felt deeply. It’s hard to put into words how much his companionship shaped my outdoor experiences, and even though he wasn’t physically there, I carried him with me on this adventure.</p>
<h3 id="reclaiming-what-was-lost">Reclaiming What Was Lost</h3>
<p>This hike wasn’t just about summiting a mountain; it was about reclaiming a piece of myself that I thought had been lost. Half Dome represented more than just a physical challenge—it was a symbol of perseverance, resilience, and the power of friendship. It reminded me that, with the right mindset and people around you, you can overcome anything life throws your way.</p>
<h3 id="closing-thought-embrace-the-struggle-love-the-journey">Closing Thought: Embrace the Struggle, Love the Journey</h3>
<p>Half Dome was exactly what I needed at that point in my life. It taught me that the most rewarding experiences often come after the hardest struggles. Whether it’s recovering from an injury, dealing with personal challenges, or just putting one foot in front of the other—each step brings you closer to something greater.</p>

This post covers the contrast between the 2 really amazing libraries.</p>
<h3 id="tldr">TLDR;</h3>
<ol>
<li>Use <code>react-beautiful-dnd</code> if your use case is to build really simple drag drop interactions for lists, without much custom requirements.</li>
<li>Use <code>react-dnd</code> if you want to be in a lot more control of the drag drop interaction, and set yourself up in a better situation for any future customization.</li>
<li>Explore <code>react-draggable</code>, <code>dragula</code> for everything in between.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<h3 id="react-dnd">react-dnd</h3>
<p><code>react-dnd</code> was created by Dan Abramov and he very well summarizes the goals of <code>react-dnd</code> in this <a href="https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/the-future-of-drag-and-drop-apis-249dfea7a15f">insightful post</a>. In it&rsquo;s implementation, <code>react-dnd</code> separates out the logic to build the drag and drop functionality into <a href="https://react-dnd.github.io/react-dnd/docs/overview"><strong><em>backends</em></strong></a>. You have the liberty to decide which backend to use. By default, <code>react-dnd</code> provides HTML5 backend which uses the HTML5 drag-drop API, but you are free to use other backends available out there (touch, mouse, etc.)</p>
<h3 id="react-beautiful-dnd">react-beautiful-dnd</h3>
<p><code>react-beautiful-dnd</code> is relatively newer, authored by Alex Reardon and supported by Atlassian. It aims at solving some of the common drag and drop interactions that are required for more &lsquo;real&rsquo; world interactions, mainly with lists and cards. It has a very simple API and you will find that it is very easy to get started. It is built by listening to mouse events to provide the drag and drop experience. It gives you a lot of features out of the box. However, if you wish to change some of this behaviour you might quickly find yourself struggling with it.</p>
<h2 id="custom-drag-preview">Custom Drag Preview:</h2>
<p>Ability to customize the UI object being dragged.</p>
<h3 id="react-beautiful-dnd-1">react-beautiful-dnd</h3>
<p>This library allows you to style your component when the drag is in progress. <em>For ex</em>: You want to show a different <code>background-color</code> or a <code>border</code> on your draggable object while it is being dragged. The creator of this library shows how you can do this in <a href="https://egghead.io/lessons/react-customise-the-appearance-of-an-app-during-a-drag-using-react-beautiful-dnd-snapshot-values">this video article</a>. However, you cannot change the dimensions of your draggable or droppable object when the drag is in progress. In most cases, you might not even want to do that. In our use-case, we wanted to make rows in our table component draggable and the UX spec dictated that we show a custom UI component that has minimal data so that the user can identify the row being dragged instead of the entire row being dragged around. <code>react-beautiful-dnd</code> does not support this out of the box since it expects the dimension of the draggable object to remain the same, you will have a hard time getting this to work as you expect.</p>
<h3 id="react-dnd-1">react-dnd</h3>
<p><code>react-dnd</code> by default provides the <code>html5-backend</code>, meaning it builds the drag-drop interaction using the HTML5 drag and drop API. The HTML5 drag-drop API does not allow changing the drag preview or its behaviour once the drag has started. However, <code>react-dnd</code> provides a <a href="https://react-dnd.github.io/react-dnd/docs/api/use-drag-layer">useDragLayer</a> API that works around this limitation. The way they recommend achieving this is by rendering an empty image in place of the drag preview, and then using the <code>useDragLayer</code> API to render whatever you want when the drag is in progress and position it based on your preferences. <a href="https://react-dnd.github.io/react-dnd/examples/drag-around/custom-drag-layer">This</a> example shows how you can do that.</p>
<h2 id="nested-drag-drop-interactions">Nested Drag Drop interactions</h2>
<p>Since <code>react-dnd</code> is a much lower level library, it does not dictate how you place your draggable and droppable containers.
<code>react-beautiful-dnd</code> on the other hand does not gracefully support nested drag and drop interactions out of the box. There are posts which will guide you on how to overcome some of these limitations.</p>
<p>Hope this was helpful. Let me know if there are any other good promising drag drop libraries that are worth exploring.</p>
