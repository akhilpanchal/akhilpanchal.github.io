I did not expect running into a lot of Frontend Developers here, but ironically the first person I spoke with was a Frontend Engineer.
We met while waiting in line for the Air Brush Studio, where you could pick either pick a T-shirt or a Bandana, a Color, and a glyph which was then printed on a tshirt of your size and given to you in 15 minutes - Damn Cool!
