Their single, Marz played a couple times through the Discover playlist on my Spotify. Few years pass by, COVID hits. In 2020 I rediscover their music. Dheere Se was a very different track, one that I did not expect from TYD. It would have been that song which a producer would have removed from the album, like Tum Ho Toh was in the movie Rock On!</description></item></channel></rss>
