### A Setback on Lion's Head
A couple of years ago, I was on what should have been just another adventure. Rajas and I were tackling Lion's Head near Toronto, Ontario, when disaster struck—I pushed my knee too hard, and it gave way. That injury turned out to be more serious than I’d imagined. Any hike after that would trigger sharp knee pain after just a few kilometers. It felt like I was sidelined forever, watching as my friends explored the outdoors without me. For almost a year, I couldn’t join them, and the frustration was real.

### Bouncing Back with a New Goal
After months of physio and working through some personal turmoil, I was determined to make a comeback. Not just any comeback, though—I had my eyes set on Half Dome, the crown jewel of Yosemite’s hikes. This wasn’t going to be easy, but I was ready to put in the work. With the support of friends and a desire to conquer my fears (and my knee), the journey began.

### Pawan's Silent Influence
One of the key figures in my preparation was my friend Pawan. Now, Pawan wasn’t my personal trainer in the traditional sense, but his habits were contagious. Watching his dedication to working out and his overall discipline made a big impact on me. His routine became a blueprint for my own training, and I got into the best shape of my life without even realizing it. You could say his presence alone was enough to push me to train hard for Half Dome.

### The Big Day: A 14-Hour Journey
The day finally came. We kicked off the Half Dome hike at 4 a.m., under the cover of darkness and excitement. The trail is no joke—steep, relentless, and with its famous cables challenge awaiting near the summit. As we ascended, we battled shifting weather and fatigue, but every step felt like a victory over the past year of struggles. When we finally reached back at the trailhead at 6 p.m., the feeling was surreal. Fourteen hours on the trail, and we had conquered it!

### Missing My Hiking Buddy, Rajas
Throughout the hike, I couldn’t help but think of Rajas. He had been there during my injury and had been such a huge part of my love for the outdoors. We had shared countless hikes together, and his absence on Half Dome was felt deeply. It’s hard to put into words how much his companionship shaped my outdoor experiences, and even though he wasn’t physically there, I carried him with me on this adventure.

### Reclaiming What Was Lost
This hike wasn’t just about summiting a mountain; it was about reclaiming a piece of myself that I thought had been lost. Half Dome represented more than just a physical challenge—it was a symbol of perseverance, resilience, and the power of friendship. It reminded me that, with the right mindset and people around you, you can overcome anything life throws your way.

### Closing Thought: Embrace the Struggle, Love the Journey
Half Dome was exactly what I needed at that point in my life. It taught me that the most rewarding experiences often come after the hardest struggles. Whether it’s recovering from an injury, dealing with personal challenges, or just putting one foot in front of the other—each step brings you closer to something greater.
