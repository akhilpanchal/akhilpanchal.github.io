It was 2018, when I first heard The Yellow Diary. Their single, [Marz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zjboLjIt8w) played a couple times through the Discover playlist on my Spotify. Few years pass by, COVID hits. In 2020 I rediscover their music. Dheere Se was a very different track, one that I did not expect from TYD. It would have been that song which a producer would have removed from the album, like Tum Ho Toh was in the movie Rock On!. Touched my heart instantly.

I recorded this in Toronto, Canada when the pandemic was at it's peak. I shared this on Instagram and TYD shared it on their stories. My year was made ðŸ˜„.
