Their single, Marz played a couple times through the Discover playlist on my Spotify. Few years pass by, COVID hits. In 2020 I rediscovered their music.
Buniyaad, another great track. This one hit me when I was listening to it while taking a shower ðŸ˜„.
Dheere Se was a very different track, one that I did not expect from TYD.</description></item><item><title>Beyond Boundaries</title><link>https://algorythm.dev/music/beyond-boundaries/</link><pubDate>Thu, 31 Aug 2017 11:41:52 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://algorythm.dev/music/beyond-boundaries/</guid><description>Abbas Ali Khan Original Credits Poet : Hasan Akber Kamal Music : Arshad Mehmood Singer: Nayyara Noor Coke Studio Pakistan has been one of my favorite music shows of all time. The show was way ahead of its time in terms of it&amp;rsquo;s music production and also the quality of music being made. Over the years it became a platform for a lot of upcoming music artists in the region to make it big in their music careers.</description></item></channel></rss>
