      <h2>💻</h2>
      <p>
        I'm Akhil Panchal, a Software Engineer by profession, driven by the challenge of making technology feel effortless.
        I aspire to write clean, efficient code that not only solves problems but also delights users.

      <h2>🎤</h2>
      <p>
        I occasionally lend my voice to music projects, collaborating with other musicians 
        on original tracks and recording live covers. Check out my <a href="/music">music page</a> for more.
      </p>

      <h2>🥾</h2>
      <p>
        When I'm not at the keyboard, you can find me hiking, running, or backpacking any chance I get.
        I love exploring the outdoors and challenging myself physically.
